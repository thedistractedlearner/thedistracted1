# Hi, I'm Dorene from The Distracted Learner! 👋

## 🧠 CS Educator & EdTech Creator

I mentor computer science (CS) teachers, teach CS students and build tools to both help save teachers' their time and help students **think computationally**.

### 🚀 Current Projects
- **[BrainstormBuddy](https://github.com/you/brainstormbuddy)** - AI-powered collaborative problem-solving for student groups
- **Debug Buddy** (Coming soon!) - Help students learn from their coding errors

### 💡 What I Believe
Every student can learn to think like a programmer. My tools help them develop that mindset **before** they write a single line of code.
Every CS teacher (new or veteran) can teach CS subjects **without** getting a programming degree! 

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`React` `Node.js` `Claude AI` `Tailwind CSS` `Educational Technology`
